Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</p>

<style>
.fill {object-fit: fill;}
.contain {object-fit: contain;}
.cover {object-fit: cover;}
.scale-down {object-fit: scale-down;}
.none {object-fit: none;}
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
</style>
