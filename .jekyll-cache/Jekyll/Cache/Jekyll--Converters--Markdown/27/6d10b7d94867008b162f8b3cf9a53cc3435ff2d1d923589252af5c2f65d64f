Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</p>

<style>
    img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 400px;
  object-fit: cover;
